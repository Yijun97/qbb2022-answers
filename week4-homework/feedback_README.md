Awesome work, this is almost exactly what we were looking for. Just one small thing:

1. When you're making your manhattan plots, you're currently plotting all of the points for a single chromosome at one point on the x-axis. We want the points spread out across the x-axis so that we can get an idea of where the associated points are. You can either plot the actual positions of the variants, or just their relative positions along the genome (i.e. first, second, third, etc.). Having them all scrunched up somewhat defeats the purpose of having a manhattan plot. (-2 points)

But, everything else is really great!
