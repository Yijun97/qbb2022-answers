Excellent work!! This is all really great. Just one minor thing:
1. Your labels for the dendrogram and heatmap are a bit funky. I think when you use the `labels` argument in the dendrogram function, it automatically rearranges the labels, so you don't actually have to do that on your end (no points deducted)

This all looks awesome.
