Beautiful plots!

Great work on exercises 1 and 2! Fantastic documentation/commentary for the unix commands, explaining what you did and why!

For the optional exercise, how does your approach to "Test whether the number of maternally inherited de novo mutations per proband is significantly different than the number of paternally inherited de novo mutations per proband." differ compared to the original exercise?
